# Face-Recognition-using-Python
A face recognition algorithm to identify faces from live feed and able to identify if it matches with anyone from the database and display their name on it. As our goal was to design a face recognition system for crime investigations, we kept False Acceptance Rate as high as we could. Intention behind keeping it high was to identify every potential suspect.
