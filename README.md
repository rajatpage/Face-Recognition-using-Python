# Face-Recognition-using-Python
A face recognition algorithm to identify faces from live feed and able to identify if it matches with anyone from the database and display their name on it. As our goal was to design a face recognition system for crime investigations, we kept False Acceptance Rate as high as we could. Intention behind keeping it high was to identify every potential suspect.

Steps to run the program:
1) Directly download the files and store it in a folder.
2) Make a new folder and name it "images"
3) For each person, make a folder with its name and store all images of one person in that folder.
4) Run "facerec-train.py" everytime you upload new images
5) Run "facerec.py" to run the program
